QA Engineer → Python Developer

Transitioning from QA to development, leveraging years of testing experience 
to write better, more reliable code.

Building portfolio projects:
- AI-powered YouTube transcription tools
- Discord automation bots  
- Web applications (Flask/FastAPI)
- Dockerized deployments with clean architecture

Tech: Python | Flask | Docker | REST APIs | Git

Open to Junior Python Developer roles where my unique QA perspective adds value.
